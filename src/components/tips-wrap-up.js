          That&apos;s my process for taking tech notes. It is crucial for my
          daily coding workflow. These are four steps to my tech note-taking
          process: identifying the problem, researching solutions, validating
          them, and reusing the knowledge. I want you to remember that
          note-taking isn&apos;t about being perfect. Jot down as freely as you
          would in a sketchbook. Make your failures productive by the effective
          tech note-taking. The most important thing is to keep coding and
          writing. I hope it&apos;s helpful for improving your productivity.
