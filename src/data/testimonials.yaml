    Former user of Evernote for years, I searched for a long time an application with a standard data format, which is fast, multiplatform (Linux), with a sense of aesthetics, Inkdrop is all that.

    Reliable app, I use it every day.

    This app is amazing. I was previously trying to use a convoluted sublime text + git method, only to find that this app had ALL of the functionality I was looking for... plus mobile!

    I use Inkdrop mainly for professional purposes. My requirements are met at 100%: pure Markdown syntax/content, good structure for content organiziation (nested categories and Tags), strong search function and local backup in readable data-format. Last but not least the UI looks good.

    I was looking for a note-taking tool in Markdown that nails the basics for a professional setting (clean interface, support for code snippets, export of .md files) and Inkdrop covers everything. The tool of course has some issues but it is continuously being improved, and I will definitely support the project in the long-run. Can only recommend!

    I just wanted to be able to sync notes from my iPhone to my Windows laptop. Organizing them with labels, notebooks, markdown, and supporting a fellow indie developer were all a bonus. I love Inkdrop and use it every day. Highly recommend!

    Well designed and efficient, the best note taking application I found over the time. Themes are convenient, tags and notebooks have become a must for me, and sync is working smoothly between windows, linux and my smartphone. Inkdrop has really become my personal notebook.

    Inkdrop is the tool I use to keep track of nearly all aspects of my personal and professional life. I’ve tried many other note-taking apps over the years, this is the first one that’s stuck. Great performance and syncs across all devices seamlessly.

    I tried a number of apps; taking notes is so specific to the writer. Inkdrop started off with a smart design, but Takuya is also dialed in to his users' needs so I've got confidence going forward.

    Fast, intuitive, & customisable, combined with frequent updates & a developer that listens. Theses are the reasons Inkdrop is one of my most used applications for personal & professional use.

    Note-taking is such a personal task and every individual does it in its own style. Markdown, vim-mode and multiplatform support are natural requirements for me. Inkdrop covers it all! I use it every day to structure professional and personal notes. The open source community and plugins are also amazing. Strongly recommend!

    I have really come to enjoy Inkdrop. I really enjoy the UI and have quickly learned markdown. It's tough to not write markdown in other note apps (Apple Notes). I really appreciate your time and dedication to this app. It's one I have come to really enjoy and use on a daily basis for organizing my thoughts, my projects, and building out software applications. Cheers to you!

    It is hard to explain the feeling of taking notes in markdown on a daily basis, there's something about inkdrop that gives me the need to write something every day.
    It has become my new study tool in my software development process, watching Takuya's videos when he is taking notes while studying motivates me a lot, it is simple and beautiful, has many cool plugins to complement your experience using the app and I love that it synchronizes your notes instantly with the mobile app so you can't miss any chance of write something anytime!

    I follow your channel and your doings for a while now and was always inspired by your videos being outside while coding, also the way of how you presented it. It combines the world of tech and the beauty of nature in very pleasing way. I looked into your app, did some warm up with Markdown and was already getting used to it. Thanks for making such a great product, I will continue doing my notes and using the app.
