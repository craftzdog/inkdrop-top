You may not familiar with JPY, right? It'd be great if users could purchase Inkdrop with USD.
Yesterday, [Stripe](https://stripe.com) has [publicly launched in Japan](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-in-japan). It finally supports for multiple currencies.
I'm happy to announce that Inkdrop pricing is now in USD.
Please check out new pricing [here](https://www.inkdrop.info/pricing).

## What happens to users who registered before the change

Nothing happens to you.
You will be charged in JPY with same price as before.
If you wish to pay with USD, please contact us.
It needs some manual steps on Stripe to change your billing currency.
