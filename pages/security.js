        <h2>Transport Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          Inkdrop uses industry standard encryption to protect your data in transit.
          This is commonly referred to as transport layer security (“TLS”) or secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.
        </p>

        <h2>Data at Rest Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          Having data encrypted will make it almost impossible for someone to access or steal a hard disk and get access to the original data.
          All your notes stored on disk in the Inkdrop database will be encrypted with a common key which is a 256-bit AES key generated when you sign up to Inkdrop.
          We use this key, along with an initialization vector, to encrypt your data in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode).
          The key is also encrypted while stored on disk, with a 256-bit AES key derived with PBKDF2 from your login password.
        </p>

        <div className='ui warning message'>
          <p>
            We never store a copy of this common key without encryption and don&apos;t use any escrow mechanism to recover your encrypted data.
            This means that if you forget your login password, we cannot recover your data and we can&apos;t even reset your password.
          </p>
        </div>
      </InfopageLayout>
